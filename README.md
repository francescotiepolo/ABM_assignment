Agent-based model of household recycling behavior using Mesa.

Python file descriptions:

model:
    agents.py  
    → Defines the Household and Bin agent classes

    core.py  
    → Implements the RecyclingModel class

analysis:
    basic_run.py  
    → Runs a basic simulation of the model
    → Here you can find a description of every parameter

    avalanches.py  
    → Analyzes avalanche events in the simulation

    sample_OFAT.py  
    → Runs a sample One-Factor-At-a-Time sensitivity analysis
